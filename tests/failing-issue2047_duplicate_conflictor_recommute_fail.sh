# We want to create this situation:
#
# Context: [adddir "./dir1", addfile "./file1.txt"]
#
# (ParTree
#     (ParTree (DP "./dir1" RmDir)
#              (Move "./file1.txt" "./dir1/file3.txt")
#     (SeqTree (DP "./dir1" RmDir) (Move "./file1.txt" "./file2.txt")))
#
# And then create the merged tree consisting of merging the second "branch" of
# a par tree into the first, depth-first.
#
# Finally, we show that commute is broken for certain combinations of
# conflictors/duplicates, since we can commute out one way, but not the
# other. We do so, by creating both orderings of the final two patches, and
# show that only in one case can we obliterate the penultimate patch alone (due
# to non-commutation).
#
# See issue2047 on the BTS for more information.
