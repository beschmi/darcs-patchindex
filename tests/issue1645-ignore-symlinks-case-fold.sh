## Test for issue1645 - Since Darcs does not version-contol symlinks,
## it should not follow them, ESPECIALLY symlinks to directories
## outside the repository. All these tests are passed with darcs-2.2
##
## See path_resolution(7) and symlink(7) for more info, especially
## the former.
##
## This only covers the case-folding test cases.
## See also the issue1645-ignore-symlinks for the main test
