-- |A splitter is something that can take a patch and (possibly) render it
-- as text in some format of its own choosing.
-- This text can then be presented to the user for editing, and the result
-- given to the splitter for parsing.
-- If the parse succeeds, the result is a list of patches that could replace
-- the original patch in any context.
-- Typically this list will contain the changed version of the patch, along
-- with fixup pieces to ensure that the overall effect of the list is the same
-- as the original patch.
-- The individual elements of the list can then be offered separately to the
-- user, allowing them to accept some and reject others.
--
-- There's no immediate application for a splitter for anything other than
-- Prim (you shouldn't go editing named patches, you'll break them!)
-- However you might want to compose splitters for FilePatchType to make
-- splitters for Prim etc, and the generality doesn't cost anything.
