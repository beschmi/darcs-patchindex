-- |This type exists for legacy support of on-disk format patch formats.
-- It is a wrapper type that explicitly tracks the nesting of braces and parens
-- in the on-disk representation of such patches. It is used as an intermediate
-- form when reading such patches normally, and also for round-tripping such
-- patches when checking the hash in bundles.
-- It shouldn't be used for anything else.
